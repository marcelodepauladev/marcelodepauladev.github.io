    <h4>You might think you've peeped the scene<br>
        You haven't, the real one's far too mean<br>
        The watered-down one, the one you know<br>
        Was made up centuries ago<br>
        They made it sound all wack and corny<br>
        Yes, it's awful blasted boring<br>
        Twisted fictions, sick addiction<br>
        Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
        I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago<br>
        Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago<br>
        That's me, the first year that I blow<br>
        How you say broke in Spanish? Me, no hablo<br>
        Me drown sorrow in that Diablo<br>
        Me found bravery in my bravado<br>
        DJs need to listen to the models<br>
        "You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"<br>
        Stupid, but what the hell do I know?<br>
        I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow<br>
        And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo<br>
        So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow<br>
        Can we get much higher?<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Look like a fat booty Céline Dion<br>
        Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis<br>
        Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher<br>
        Tell me, how do you respond to students?<br>
        And refresh the page and restart the memory?<br>
        Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?<br>
        We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies<br>
        Sorry for the night demons that still visit me<br>
        The plan was to drink until the pain over<br>
        But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?<br>
        Fresh air, rollin' down the window<br>
        Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low<br>
        Don't make me pull the toys out, huh<br>
        Don't make me pull the toys<br>
        And fire up the engines, huh<br>
        And then they make noise<br>
        Can we get much higher? So high<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        At the mall, there was a séance<br>
        Just kids, no parents<br>
        Then the sky filled with herons<br>
        (I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron<br>
        And the hell, it wouldn't spare us<br>
        And the fires did declare us<br>
        But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress<br>
        And woke up back in Paris<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh<br>
        Can we get much higher? (So high)<br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh</h4>
